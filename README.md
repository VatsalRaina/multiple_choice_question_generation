# Multiple Choice Question Generation

The aim is to generate sophisticated multiple-choice questions when given only a contextual paragraph. Therefore, the system must be able to generate both the question and the answer options. The answer options must be sophisticated such that they are not simple extracts from the contextual paragraph. The focus here will be on designing questions similar to the RACE dataset.
